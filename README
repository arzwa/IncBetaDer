Partial derivatives of the incomplete beta function `beta(a, b, x)` (and its
inverse) with respect to `a`, `b` and `x`, with a gradient function for
ForwardDiff.

**Note:** ideally this should be implemented to generally allow this in AD
applications. However, currently this is not very well unified across forward
and reverse mode libraries. I think in the future we should implement this
using ChainRules, but at the moment ForwardDiff (which I need) doesn't use
ChainRules (ForwardDiff uses DiffRules, but that doesn't seem to be the place
to implement these numerical things).
